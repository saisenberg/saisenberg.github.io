excerpt: "The Buffalo Bills lost their opening game by 44 points. Surely their fans exhibited the most negativity in the league... right?"

<hr>
This past weekend, the American sports world turned its eyes to the first matchups of the 2018 NFL regular season. From Thursday night to Monday night, we watched Sam Darnold and Patrick Mahomes impress in their debuts, and watched as a one-legged Aaron Rodgers commandeered a twenty-point comeback against Chicago. We saw teams that were expected to lose – the Bills and Raiders, for example – get blown out, and teams that were supposed to win – most notably, the Saints and Lions – upset by their presumed weaker opponents. We even watched as Cleveland finally ended their seventeen-game losing streak in the most quintessentially Browns way possible – by playing their AFC North rival Steelers to a draw.

After the Bills-Ravens game mercifully concluded, with Baltimore walloping Buffalo by a final score of 47-3, morbid curiosity brought me to [*r/buffalobills*](https://www.reddit.com/r/buffalobills/), the Bills-specific forum (or “*subreddit*”) of [*Reddit*](https://reddit.com), where Bills fans’ early reviews of the team’s first game were less than stellar:

Intuition might suggest that since Buffalo had lost by the largest margin of any team in the league, their fanbase would have been the most negatively impacted by the loss. On the other hand, the Bills were largely expected to struggle this season; after all, they traded starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor in March, and were starting a quarterback who had, less than a year ago, thrown [five interceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5X3fYIbGQA) in only one half of play. A fun exercise, therefore, would be quantifying Bills fans’ negativity – was the Buffalo subreddit demonstrably the most negative of all thirty-two teams? And if not, which fanbase had the worst Week 1?

First, I scraped thousands of rows of data for each NFL team, with each row representing a comment for any post left on that team’s subreddit between noon on Thursday, September 9 and 4:00 PM on Tuesday, September 11. A Python library, [*PRAW*](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), exists for the express purpose of scraping Reddit submissions and comments, and although *PRAW* can collect only the thousand most recent posts in a subreddit, this proved a non-issue, as no team’s subreddit had even close to that many posts in such a short time span.

After data collection, I used the *VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer* algorithm within Python’s *nltk* library to perform sentiment analysis on each individual comment. Sentiment analysis determines the overall positivity or negativity in a given piece of text, as well as the sentiment’s overall intensity (or “polarity”), while also accounting for slang, negation, and strength of language. Every subreddit comment is given four scores: positivity, negativity, neutrality (i.e., neither positive nor negative), and “compound,” which is an amalgam of the others. While a comment can be partly positive, partly negative, and partly neutral, all three scores must sum to 1 (see the [attached link](http://www.nltk.org/howto/sentiment.html) for examples). While all individual positivity, negativity, and neutrality scores can take values in the range [0, 1], I will be multiplying every score by a hundred for ease of reading.

However, before performing sentiment analysis, I first had to separate all contractions (e.g., “don’t” or “hasn’t”) and remove all Reddit-style [HTML](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting) from each comment, as well as additional unnecessary punctuation. I also deleted every mention of “Luck” from the Colts’ subreddit, as *VADER* cannot distinguish between the dictionary definition of luck (which it considers a “positive” word) and the word in the context of Colts quarterback Andrew Luck. The word “super” was also subject to removal - this time league-wide. Because teams with 2018 Super Bowl aspirations are more likely to use the word "super" (which, again, *VADER* considers positive), inclusion of the word would artificially inflate that team’s positivity scores.

But enough of the boring technical details – on to the results!

**Teams**

As follows is a scatterplot of the positivity and negativity of each subreddit’s average comment between Thursday and Tuesday nights. The happiest fanbases (i.e., the subreddits with the highest average positivity and lowest average negativity) appear in the lower right-hand corner of the plot, and the least happy fanbases appear in the upper-left. Each data point has also been color-coded in accordance with the outcome of that team’s game.

While Buffalo may have suffered the worst loss of Week 1, their rivals in Miami had by far the highest average negative sentiment across the league. Much of this can likely be attributed to the lightning storms that twice delayed their opening game. The Titans, in fact, had the lowest mean positivity score across the league. Sitting through [the longest game in NFL history](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24630193/titans-dolphins-game-goes-nfl-record-7-hours-8-minutes) clearly soured the mood of both Dolphins and Titans fans.

Aside from Miami and Tennessee, we can observe that the Cowboys, Lions, Saints, Cardinals, and Falcons’ fanbases – all of whom watched their respective teams lose – also had particularly rough weeks. For the most part, the graph cleanly splits between winning and losing teams; [*r/Colts*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colts/) and [*r/49ers*](http://reddit.com/r/49ers), however, both buck this trend, with the former subreddit actually finishing the weekend with the highest positivity score in the league.

Also of note is the relative proximity between the Steelers and Browns data points after the teams tied. It stands to reason that while neither fanbase is overly enthusiastic after a draw - indeed, the two points are very close to each other - Cleveland’s data point still lies further toward the bottom-right corner than that of Pittsburgh. While simply not losing was an accomplishment for the Browns, the Steelers expected to emerge victorious, and their fans, therefore, were likely more negative both during the game and after its conclusion.

Additionally, while New York Jets fans had the lowest negativity score in the league – which makes sense, given the fantastic Week 1 play of rookie quarterback Sam Darnold – they still finished with a relatively low positivity score. Perhaps years of disappointment have simply left the Jets fanbase incapable of happiness.

So how do we definitively decide which fanbases had the best and worst Week 1 in the league? By subtracting each subreddit’s mean negativity from its mean positivity, we can rank teams by their *net positivity scores*. Here are the results, ranked from best to worst:

<center><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nfl-week1/sentiment_rankings.png" alt="sentiment rankings"></center><br>

According to net positivity, the Denver Broncos’ fanbase had the happiest Week 1, with the Miami Dolphins finishing last. Looking at the *Game Result* column, we can still observe a fairly clean split between winning teams and losing teams, showing that fanbases of winning teams do exhibit more positivity than fanbases of losing ones. Winning margin, however, appears to play little part in a team’s ranking; the #1-ranked Broncos won their matchup by just three points, while the #17 Ravens beat the Bills by over forty. Interestingly, the entire AFC North – regardless of win, loss, or tie – huddles around the middle of the rankings; the Ravens and eighteenth-ranked Bengals both won their games, but still finished with less net positivity than Cleveland.

Also notable is the mammoth gap between the Dolphins’ net positivity score (0.57) and that of the 31st-ranked Titans (2.16). We've already discussed the impact of the long rain delay on both fanbases' sentiment - but maybe post-by-post analysis can help us pinpoint the specific reason for such a large gap…

**Posts**

As follows are the individual posts which resulted in comments with the highest mean positivity and negativity. I have excluded posts with fewer than twenty-five comments from this section of results so that posts with very few – but very polarized – comments do not dominate the list. I have also excluded posts whose inclusion on the list was only due to [one user’s repetition of the same word or phrase](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/9eef29/vikings_suicide_pact_2018_rules_etc/).

Here are the three most positive posts, along with each post’s mean positivity score and relevant team:

1. Patriots (49.2): [Phillip Dorsett becomes the 69th player to catch a TD from Tom Brady](https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/9egslx/phillip_dorsett_becomes_the_69th_player_to_catch/)
2. Packers (34.1): [The Office: Green Bay Packers edition!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/9e99eh/the_office_green_bay_packers_edition/)
3. Patriots (33.9): [Over at /r/Texans, we make a weekly hype video, mashing up a movie trailer with our opponent. Since we have y’all on Sunday in New England, here’s our trailer! “Marvel: The Texans- Infinity War”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/9dy2uu/over_at_rtexans_we_make_a_weekly_hype_video/)<br>

Now, as follows are the three most negative posts of Week 1. If you look closely, you might spot a common theme (one that might help explain a certain phenomenon in an earlier section):

1. Dolphins (44.6): [IT’S F*** THE JETS WEEK](https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/9ekwsx/its_fuck_the_jets_week/)
2. Dolphins (35.6): [Sam Darnold’s first pass is a pick f*** the Jets](https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/9es4a1/sam_darnold_first_pass_is_a_pick_6_fuck_the_jets/)
3. Dolphins (24.3): [Yo so the Jets actually look aight](https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/9et5bg/yo_so_the_jets_actually_look_aight/)
<hr>
**Comments**

Just as we did on a post-by-post level, we can also identify the overall most positive and negative comments of the weekend. For each subreddit, I found the 67th percentile of the length (in characters) of that subreddit's comments, and, for purposes of this list, am only including comments between the 67th and 100th percentiles. Additionally, the following lists comprise only comments with at least twenty-five upvotes.

Here are the three most positive comments of Week 1:

1. Browns (57.2): [“Feeling pretty good about this. They played like they belonged and I feel like we woulda won if not for the weather.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Browns/comments/9eiuuz/well/e5pe6tt/) *(Long_island_iced_Z)*
2. Patriots (57.0): [“That was amazing, great work! The 6 stones and banner reference made me laugh! Good luck Sunday, let’s hope it’s injury free.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/9dy2uu/over_at_rtexans_we_make_a_weekly_hype_video/e5kxvpr/) *(Kingjimmy666)*
3. Packers (51.7): [“Seems to have a great attitude and puts team success over personal success. You love having guys like that in the locker room.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/9erk5y/jimmy_graham/e5qzj0g/) *(IsYouWitItYaBish)*<br>

And the three most negative:

1. Packers (60.2): [“He was p\*\*\*ing me off so much yesterday. Poor contain, poor tackling, poor coverage in the flat, and that stupid a** penalty.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/9epw8f/andy_herman_on_twitter_clay_matthews_with_a/e5qpass/) *(ImaTurtle6)*
2. Jets (48.8): [“Sam would also beat his a\*\* in a street fight. Edit: super disappointed in myself I forgot this, F\*\*\* the pats”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/9dr93o/fun_fact_tom_brady_chose_the_number_12_because_it/e5jjhna/) *(Randyfreakingmarsh)*
3. Bengals (44.7): [“F** THE NFL PANSY RULES, F\*\*\* THE REFS, F\*\*\* AJ'S FUMBLEITIS, AND HARDCORE F\*\*\* THE ANDREW LUCK COMEBACK NARRATIVE B\*\*\*\*\*\*\* AND THE STEELERS! WHO DEY!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/9eg0hf/bengals_win_fejedelem_mvp_upvote_party/e5olsbu/) *(PM_Me_Your_PBnJ)*
<hr>
**Words**

Finally, we can use *nltk*’s *FreqDist* function to identify common words contained in each subreddit’s most negative comments. This way, we can achieve a rough idea of what specific topics have inspired the most negativity for each fanbase.
I have removed all curse words from the following results, but rest assured that *every single team’s* list of most common negatively-associated words included at least four or five curses.

```
r/49ers: jimmy (6), cancer (5)
r/azcardinals: suck (9), rosen (7), bradford (7), riot (6)
r/bengals: steelers (16), penalty (12), nfl (9), blah (6)
r/browns: steelers (11), sucks (11), offense (10)
r/buccaneers: saints (12), fire (11), cannons (6), smith (6)
r/buffalobills: tyrod (6), really (6), suck (5), line (5)
r/chargers: hate (6), chiefs (5), bolt (5), cut (5)

r/nyjets: hate (7), hurt (7), suck (5), pats (5)
r/oaklandraiders: carr (19), talib (17), hate (16), mack (14)
r/panthers: hate (5), fire (4)
r/patriots: brady (10), hate (8), lions (7)
r/ravens: steelers (15), bills (13), hate (7)
r/redskins: dallas (7), giants (5), cowboys (4)
r/saints: falcons (13), hate (9), ryan (8)
r/seahawks: announcers (12), ifedi (8), fire (6), offense (5)
r/steelers: ben (13), offense (9), penalty (8)
r/tennesseetitans: dolphins (9), hate (8), worst (8), refs (7)
r/texans: johnson (8), kevin (7), call (6), watson (6)
```

A few takeaways:

*	Bengals, Browns, and Ravens fans *all* associate the Steelers with negativity – even though only Cleveland played them in Week 1.
  * The Broncos and Chiefs’ subreddits express similar sentiment towards Oakland, and the Saints’ fanbase has a special hatred for Matt Ryan and the Falcons.
  *	Dolphins fans exhibit negativity towards their entire division, but *especially* towards the Jets (as we learned in the *Posts* section).
*	Bills fans still miss Tyrod Taylor.
*	Atlanta’s fanbase is fed up with their offensive coordinator, Steve “Sark” Sarkisian.
*	Giants fans have seen enough of offensive tackle Ereck Flowers.
*	[*r/oaklandraiders*](https://www.reddit.com/r/oaklandraiders/) is concerned with the recent play of Derek Carr. They also associate departed linebacker Khalil Mack and opposing cornerback Aqib Talib with negativity.
*	Seattle fans were evidently displeased with the announcers of their game against Denver.

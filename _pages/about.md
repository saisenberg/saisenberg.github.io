I have a fascination with all things data - especially as it relates to sports, music, and other forms of entertainment. Specific areas of expertise include machine learning and data visualization, and I am experienced in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau.

Originally from Philadelphia, I've since relocated to Greater Boston to study Data Science & Analytics at the University of New Hampshire. In between, I spent four years at Washington University in St. Louis, and worked at Deloitte from 2016 through 2018 as a consultant in financial services.

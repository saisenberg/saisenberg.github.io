I have a fascination with all things data - especially as it relates to sports, music, and other forms of entertainment - and am experienced in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Particular areas of expertise include machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization.

Originally from Philadelphia, I've since relocated to Greater Boston to study Data Science & Analytics at the University of New Hampshire. In between, I spent four years at Washington University in St. Louis, and worked at Deloitte from 2016 through 2018 as a consultant in financial services.

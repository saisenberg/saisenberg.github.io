My name is Sam Isenberg. Originally from Philadelphia, I've since relocated to the Greater Boston area to study Data Science & Analytics at the University of New Hampshire. In between, I spent four years at Washington University in St. Louis, and worked at Deloitte from 2016 through 2018 as a consultant in financial services.

I have an interest in all things data - especially as it relates to sports and other forms of entertainment - and am experienced in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Particular areas of expertise include machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization.
